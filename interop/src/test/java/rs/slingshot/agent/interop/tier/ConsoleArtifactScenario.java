 * A console artifact download, on a running instance.

 * <p>What a unit suite proves is that the paging arithmetic is right. What it cannot prove is that
 * the command is registered on a real runtime, that a window survives the transport intact, and
 * that the rules its own registry row states are the ones the instance actually applies.</p>
 *
 * <p>The operation-key rule is read from the row rather than restated. This command refuses a key
 * and the command beside it in the same package requires one; a test that wrote either rule down
 * again would pass on the day somebody changed the row and forgot the test, which is the day it
